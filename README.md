# Lecture notes MAT 4360 -- C^*-algebras

This repository contains my lecture notes, from Erik Bedos's lectures in the
course MAT 4360. These notes are equal to what Erik have written on the
blackboard, almost everywhere (in the mathematical sens). I could however have
produced some typos, so if you do find some, please create a pull request or
send me a message.
